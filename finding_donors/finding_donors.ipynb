    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "\n",
    "Random Forest - Random forests are used in image classification which can be applied in aerial and satellite imaging and mapping. http://wgrass.media.osaka-cu.ac.jp/gisideas10/viewpaper.php?id=342\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Strengths of the model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest -  It is non-parametric, capable of using continuous and categorical data sets, easy to parametrize, not sensitive to over-fitting, good at dealing with outliers in training data, and it calculates ancillary information such as classification error and variable importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN - Simple to implement and is a lazy learner. Highly efficient and effective algorithm for pattern recognition particularly in real time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM - When used with regularisation parameter, it is very good in avoiding over-fitting. The true power of SVM lies in the kernel trick, so you can build in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernel. Thirdly an SVM is defined by a convex optimisation problem (no local minima) for which there are efficient methods (SMO).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Weaknesses of the model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest - Sometimes forests can be quite slow to create predictions once trained. More accurate ensembles require more trees, which means using the model becomes slower. Also they don't do  well when you require extrapolation outside of the range of the dependent (or independent) variables. May overfit for some datasets, because they are biased towards features with more levels (when determining variable importance for splitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN - The need to determine the value of K although sometimes random optimisation can used to overcome this. In distance based learning it is sometimes not clear which type of \"distance\" to use and which attributes to use to produce best results. Computation cost can be high in large datasets because of the need to compute each query instance with all training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM - The disadvantages are that the theory only really covers the determination of the parameters for a given value of the regularisation and kernel parameters and choice of kernel. In a way the SVM moves the problem of over-fitting from optimising the parameters to model selection. Also SVM tends to be slow in very large datasets with high number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "** What makes it a good candidate **\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest - There are a lot of features and it is unclear which features matter most in regards to if a person earns >50k or not. Random Forests will discriminate over a variety of features use a voting method of feature subsets to determine which boundaries to split on. Also help eliminate the issue of instability of decision trees and are more robust and help avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN - It seems to be likely that the features are inter-related in the sense that factors like level of education and some of the lifestyle choices of the individuals can certainly help map a sort of similarity among the those who earn >50k. And KNN would be very efficient in finding this similarity and assigning class labels accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM - The intuition of a 'large margin' is highly fitting for this data set with many features . The kernel trick can be employed to obtain better knowledge of the dataset in higher dimensions and a highly robust and complex, nonlinear decision boundary can be obtained using SVM."

    "\n",
    "It is evident that, among the three chosen models, random forest outperforms the others in various aspects. The total training and prediction time is the lowest for random forrests in all training set sizes. SVM takes a very long time when training set size is 100% : this is because it has to compute a lot of support vectors to construct the complex decision boundary. KNN on the other hand takes highest prediction time because it has to query a single instance with the whole training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of F-score and accuracy, random forest performs the best on the training set and performs a bit poorly, but equivalently good, on the testing set. This is a typical indicator of overfitting and that the algorithm is not generalizing well to new examples. This gap between train/test error can be reduced by refining and tuning some of the paramters.\n",
    "On the other hand, SVM and KNN perform poorly on the training and testing sets in terms of F-score and accuracy. Although the results for SVM and KNN are sort of consistent through the training and testing sets, random forrest still stands out in all cases and with just little tweaking can become very robust and give better performance on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so overall, based on the initial model evaluation, Random Forest would be an appropriate model for this classification task."

Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction.

    "\n",
    "A rationale to begin with is that, we can use different learning models to improve the accuracy of classification which is the main idea behind the technique called bagging.Bagging is basically averaging unbiased and noisy models in order to create another model with lower variance in terms of classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are built on this underlying concept of bagging. Random forest or Random Decision Forest works as a large collection of decorrelated decision trees.Subsets of the data are created using random samples from the training set. And then a decision tree is created on that subset. Many such subsets are created and therefore many decision trees. Now when a new sample is queried for prediction(i.e class label for that new instance), predictions from all these trees are obtained. And the class with the highest number of votes is then assigned to the sample.\n"

    "F-score is a fair metric to test in the domain of skewed classes, because it takes into account both precision and recall.\n",

    "As compared to the naive predictor, the optimized model performs much better. This is because the naive predictor gives only a single class label and it's accuracy highly dependant on the distribution of the dataset."

    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "\n",
    "Capital Gain - This feature is a direct indicator of income level as low income level individuals tend to have low capital gains as they do not have much money left to save or invest after their expenses. And hence this is a very important feature and takes rank 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marital Status - If an individual is married and has a family, he/she has whole new addition of expenses to take care of. In cases of a divorce, the person has to contribute towards the expenses of any children they may have or even have to pay alimony. Whereas a single person, has more money at disposal, and can make investments to make more money. This way their income level is affected and so this ranks number 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Education- An individuals' education is related to how much salary he/she makes. Individuals with masters level or PhD level education are specialists and have high pay. This feature also relates to the occupation and working class of the individual. And so this feature has a strong impact and ranks number 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weekly Hours- The weekly hours that an individual works for is also related to his/her salary. In many cases salary is calculated weekly and so income is related to this feature and ranks number 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age - Age is a factor that can affect work ethic, efficiency and hours worked. Also older people tend to be settled and have families which again factors in to the amount of money at their disposal. Younger people are enthusiastic, and flexible, and can work overtime thereby making more money. And this feature is important to establish this realtionship and ranks 5.\n"

    "The five features that are in the visualization sort of confirms my intuition as discussed in Question 6. Although I got the ranks a bit wrong, it still sort of explains my intuition that features like capital gain, education and marital status most influence the income level of an individual. \n",
    "A better representation of education is given by the education-number (a single numeric value), rather than educational level which is a categorical variable, enumerated using one-hot encoding. And so education-number is a better feature for modeling the data.\n",
    "But overall, the intuition, that there is an increasing awareness to go for higher education and to make investments and retire early (thereby explaining the age factor), is captured in the results above, and these features strongly contribute to an individuals' income level.\n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "But training time will certainly be reduced when lesser features are used. It is a good policy to use to address the problem of overfitting. In the case of SVM where the relative training time was too high this sort of reduced feature set can definitely be considered at the expense of accuracy being lowered.\n",
    "But the randomization and cumulative voting feature of the random forests reduced the training time of the model, as the algorithm looks at subsets of data. And so using reducing data may not be a smart strategy for random forests as it is likely, that anyway the decision trees make top splits based on the above, most important, features because of the split criterion. And so the other features in the lower nodes sort of contribute to the higher F-score and accuracy, and as training time is not a factor, trading off accuracy for reduced complexity is not a plausible thing to do."
